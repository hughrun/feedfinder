# Contributing

Contributions in the form of bug reports, suggestions, or code are very welcome.

## Bug reports

Please [log an Issue](/issues) to report any bugs you find. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for me to identify the cause and, hopefully, fix it. Things that are useful to know include:

* what you expected to happen
* what actually happened
* what versions of nodejs and npm you were using
* what operating system you were using
* the content of any error messages

## Suggestions

Suggestions for new features or improvements are welcome, though I make no guarantees they will be implemented. _feedfinder_ is intentionally a simple tool that does only two things. If you want to make a suggestion, please [log an Issue](/issues).

## Code

Code contributions are welcome, however please do not log a pull request without having raised and discussed [an Issue](/issues). Significant new features are unlikely to be implemented.
